# Support Ticket: Horiseon

## Description

In this project, Horiseon submitted a support ticket asking for us to implement accessibility standards so that their website can have search engine optimization.

Looking into their HTML and Stylesheet there were elements and selectors that were repetitive or used incorrectly. One important thing that I learned during class is that we should always leave codes cleaner than how we found them, which is what I did for Horiseon. 

Beginning with the HTML, the biggest thing that I noticed was that there were several div elements being used instead of semantic HTML elements. So I began with inserting a head, body, main, and footer elements. These semantic elements replaced most div elements.

Next was cleaning up the CSS stylesheet. There many class selectors being used for individual elements. So I created a single class and implemented it within the html elements. 

Throughout this project, I learned that there are many different ways to implement code that will result in the same outcome. The biggest challenge is learning how to choose the best option out of the correct ones.
