# Support Ticket: Horiseon

## Description
What was your motivation?
In this project, Horiseon submitted a support ticket asking for us to implement accessibility standards so that their website can have search engine optimization.


Why did you build this project?

What problem does it solve?

Looking into their HTML and Stylesheet there were elements and selectors that were repetitive or used incorrectly. One important thing that I learned during class is that we should always leave codes cleaner than how we found them, which is what I did for Horiseon. 

Beginning with the HTML, the biggest thing that I noticed was that there were several div elements being used instead of semantic HTML elements. So I began with inserting a head, body, main, and footer elements.
